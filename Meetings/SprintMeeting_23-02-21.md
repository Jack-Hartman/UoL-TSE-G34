# Meeting 2 
Gather data and start to import that into python with pandas

* Figure out the tasks we would like the code to perform -
    * analysing two countries data against ech other and producing data from that etc? 
    * Having a nice user interface with many graphs and tables
    * Etc
* based of the tasks we can create roles.

Tasks i think we should have the program be able 2 do

Program start
User Select continent of first country
User Select first country
Prompt to see if want to compare with another continent/s within or outside of the current continent
If User within
    Stay within continent dictionary eg: "Africa dictionary/list"
If User Outside 
    Switch to new selected continent dictionary

Inside continent comparison & outside continent comparison maybe able to select which you want to do?
Present data from a single country
Analyse data from 2 countries together

* Maybe add more than 3 countrys per continent - could argue that we change this because in the direction we we're previously taking we thought data sets would be limted and harder to find and now we had cahnge the topic to be similar just more broad we can find much more data and therefore add more data - maybe only add more if we have the time tho.

## Roles

Ploting graphs - matplotlib - galani

Gathering all datasets and importing them with pandas

Front-end - User view - Jack & Tom
Back end - Joe & Max / galani
Matplotlib - Galani

## Data-sets
https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/covid/ - contains "total tests" 
"total tests" - may be an intresting side analytic? - can be a way of letting us know how the country is handling the pandemic

# What are we expecting from the program?

Interactive covid analyser - 
* able to select a country and view that countries data. 
* Able to select 2 countries and comapare their data to one another.

# What type of stuff is front end expecting from the back end

Infection rate
Death rate
Totals test
Tests per case
Crude CFR - fatality rate     
Total cases

* "Plotly" for front end displaying graphs
