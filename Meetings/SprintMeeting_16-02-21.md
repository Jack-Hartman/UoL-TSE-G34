# Meeting plan
* Go over previous assignment and talk about what we couldve done better/review feedback
* Read breif and talk about how we want to approch it with our topic
* Rehash plan - Make sure we all know what we aim to do with the project / re-read last assignment
* Feedback of previous assignment

"Two peaks" - i talk about this in the plan but when is this?
Maybe we want to change the assignment to how each country handled there "major spikes" - take the 2 worst points in every country and compare - how long they lasted. people to population infection rate... etc
talk to team ^^

If we change plan we can talk asbout this is the "Software engineering" section of the report - about how we took an agile model.

# Report
## Software engineering
Agile?
Changed plan
This model allowed us to use the feedback gained from the regular sprint meetings to change and adapt our plan.

How are we getting the data? - pandas
How are we comparing the data? - matplotlib

Find multiple website sources for pandas

## Advice from horia

Risk analysis - not enough data-sets for "gender & ethinitcy" will swap to comparing how each country handled it... infection rate vs infection rate.

One of the things we need to do is plan roles properly.
